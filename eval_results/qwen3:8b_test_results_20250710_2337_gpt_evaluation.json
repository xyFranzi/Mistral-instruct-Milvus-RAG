      "llm_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking who Meursault is and his role in \"The Stranger\" (Der Fremde). I need to use the provided documents to answer accurately.\n\nFirst, looking at the first document: It mentions that Meursault is an introverted man who committed a murder and is awaiting execution in his cell. The story is set in 1930s Algeria, and his name might have a derivation from \"Meurs, sot!\" which translates to \"Stirb, (du) Trottel!\" So, he's the protagonist, the killer, and the main character.\n\nThe second document says the story starts with his mother's death, and he shows no emotion at the funeral, indicating a cold relationship. The narrative follows his life from his perspective after the funeral. This shows his emotional detachment and how it's central to the plot.\n\nThird document describes him as someone who lives aimlessly, notices details but remains indifferent to violence and injustice. His affair after his mother's funeral is later used as evidence of his emotional coldness. This highlights his apathy and how it's a key aspect of his character.\n\nPutting it all together: Meursault is the protagonist of \"The Stranger,\" a murderer awaiting execution. His emotional detachment and indifference are central to the story, leading to his trial and the themes of alienation and absurdism. The documents consistently point to his role as the main character whose actions and traits drive the narrative.\n</think>\n\nMeursault ist der Protagonist des Romans *Der Fremde* (französisch: *L'Étranger*) von Albert Camus. Er ist ein introvertierter, emotional abgegrenzter Mann, der im Algerien der 1930er Jahre lebt. Seine Rolle im Werk ist zentral, da seine Handlungen und Charaktereigenschaften die zentralen Themen des Romans – wie die menschliche Isolation, die Absurdität des Lebens und die gesellschaftliche Verurteilung – verdeutlichen.  \n\n**Hauptaspekte seiner Rolle:**  \n1. **Mord und Strafe:** Meursault bringt seine Mutter tödlich um und wird deshalb zum Tode verurteilt. Sein Mord ist der Auslöser für die Handlung und die gesellschaftliche Auseinandersetzung um seine Persönlichkeit.  \n2. **Emotionale",

      "llm_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to answer how Camus portrays existentialism and the feeling of absurdity in \"The Stranger.\" Let me start by recalling what I know about existentialism and absurdity. Existentialism is about individual freedom, choice, and the search for meaning in an apparently meaningless world. Absurdism deals with the conflict between humans' desire for meaning and the universe's silence.\n\nLooking at the provided documents, they mention Meursault's emotional detachment, his routine life, and his lack of emotion during his mother's funeral. These points might relate to existential themes. For example, Meursault's indifference could show his awareness of life's absurdity, as he doesn't seek meaning in his actions. His routine life might reflect existentialism's focus on individual freedom and the absence of inherent meaning.\n\nThe documents also note that Meursault's actions, like the affair and the murder, are driven by his own desires without societal expectations, which ties into existentialism. The trial in the novel, where he's judged for his emotional detachment, might highlight the absurdity of societal norms imposing meaning on his life.\n\nI should connect these points to Camus' themes. Meursault's indifference to societal norms and his focus on personal experience could illustrate existentialism. The feeling of absurdity is shown through his awareness that life has no inherent meaning, leading to his detachment. The documents mention his routine life and emotional coldness, which support the idea of living authentically despite the absurdity.\n\nI need to make sure the answer ties the examples from the documents to the philosophical concepts. Also, check if there's any mention of the trial or the structure of the novel that relates to these themes. The documents don't mention the trial details, but the emotional detachment and routine life are key points. So, the answer should focus on Meursault's actions and his lack of emotional engagement as examples of existentialism and absurdity.\n</think>\n\nCamus zeigt in *Der Fremde* den Existentialismus und das Gefühl der Absurdität durch die Charaktereigenschaften und Handlungen von Meursault. \n\n1. **Existentialismus**:  \n   Meursault lebt in einer Zustandslosigkeit, die die Existenzialisten wie Sartre oder Kierkegaard beschreiben würden. Er handelt aus eigenem Willen, ohne sich an gesellschaftliche Normen oder moralische Erwartungen zu binden. Seine Gewalttätigkeit (der",
